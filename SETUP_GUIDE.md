## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```

### 2. Configure Firebase (Optional for Demo)
The app works with mock data, but for full functionality:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable Firestore Database
4. Get your config and update `src/config/firebase.ts`

### 3. Run the App
```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Run on different platforms
npm run ios      # iOS Simulator
npm run android  # Android Emulator  
npm run web      # Web Browser
```

### 4. Test the App
- **Demo PIN**: `1234`
- **Features to try**:
  - Spin the surprise wheel on the home screen
  - Complete daily challenges
  - Add photos to the gallery
  - Explore settings and customization

### Changing Colors

  }
}
```

### Adding Features

3. **Customize challenges** and features for your relationship
4. **Deploy to app stores** when ready

## Troubleshooting
